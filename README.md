# Working through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

I recently started working through the [wizard book](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html) to brush up on some core computer science.
This is an excellent textbook to learn the fundamentals of computer programming, and I had a lot of fun solving the exercises.
This repo contains my solutions (will update as I make progress).
